# ESP32-S3-BOX template project

This is a minimal project setup for playing around with the ESP32 S3 BOX device.

In order to set up your environment on macOS have a peek at [ESP-IDF setup on macOS](https://borud.no/dev/2022/esp-idf-setup/).

Check out, then run:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Make sure it builds using:

```shell
idf.py build
```
